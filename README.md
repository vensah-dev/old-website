# Vensah-dev.github.io

Welcome to my protfolio. This website was created roughly in 11 days while learning HTML and CSS even though the commits say it was around 2-3 months ago as I had gotten caught up with other work like uhm sleeping?

## Pages
### About
The about page is the first page you will land on when you open my website*. The about page can be scrolled through like slides to learn more about me, the effect works best on chrome and for some reason not arc even though they're both chromium based. 

### Achievements
Thats right an entire subpage dedicated to all of my achievements! as of now it's not very mobile friedly though you still can open it on mobile so yea

### Projects
Filled with all my projects like this one as of now 20/4/2024 its not complete but it has a few projects you can check out. It's pretty mediocre except for the HOVER EFFECT I spent way to long on.

*You will only land on the about page if my website works...
